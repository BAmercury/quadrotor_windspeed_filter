Wind speed sensor filter design considerations


Data we have:
    - Measurement with no wind and vehicle movement
        - Matches ground speed with some deviation of error
            - What is this deviation
        - From a preliminary view we can see that this shows the vehicle can induce flow through the sensor
          that may be proporinate to ground speed (So assuming this is airspeed, ground + wind)
What we want:
    - In the end, we want a measurement of the airspeed, windspeed, and groundspeed

What data we need:
    - We need a new set of data that will encompass the dynamics of the sensor plus its relationship to the UMAR quadrotor
        - So prop wash effects, even if the sensor is placed in "clean air" are we placing it high enough where its getting clean air?
            - Assume that prop wash effects might be there
        - How does movement affect the sensor?
            - How does longitudinal movement affect the sensor
            - How does lattitude movement affect sensor
            - how does attitude changes affect the sensor?
            - Basically, airflow will change with movement of drone. So we must take into consideration that we can't measure
              windspeed without filtering out the vehicle movement

In the end I aim for my filter to output: Ground speed, Windspeed, and Airspeed (Speed of vehcile relative to wind)


Edge cases:
    - If vehicle is moving translationally WITH the wind, then it's apprent airspeed will be higher than ground speed
    - If it's fighting the wind, groundspeed could be 0 but the airspeed could be some value (Drone is flying to fight the wind via opposite driectoin)


Notes on the logger program itself:
    - Log file structure:
        - Time,Wind Speed,Horizontal Direction,Vertical Direction,Temperature,Pressure,Pitch,Roll,Magnetic Heading
    - Update rate: 5hz
    - Boolean at line 90 of the TransonicaLogger.cs should be set to true, so we can log everything
    - Or modify the SSS logs to log everything

Current set of data (LogSet_1)
    - Manuever identifable, i could potentially work off this data
    - Sensor placement is a factor in terms of noise
    - New sets of data would be used to validate performance of filter and model
    - need better ardupilot vehicle log


What do I have:
    - Ground speed data (magnitude)
    - Wind sensor measurement (process variable that needs to be filtered)
        - Wind sensor measurement could be airspeed? 
    - Pitch and roll measurements from the trinsonica
    - altitutde
